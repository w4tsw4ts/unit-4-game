# unit-4-game

This is a simple game that gives you a random number at the beginnig of the game.  We will call this number your goal number.  

You will then have 4 crystals to pick from.  Each crystal has a random number assigned to it that you cannot see.  

Your mission is to click on the crystals to get their random numbers to add up to the same number as the goal number given to you at the start of the game.  If you your total crystal numbers goes over the goal number you lose.
